# Trip Based Modeling of Fuel Consumption in Modern Fleet Vehicles Using Machine Learning

A fleet vehicle is a car owned by an organization, not an individual.

Fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on several internal factors such as distance, load, vechicle characteristics and driver behaviour as well as external factors such as road conditions, traffic and weather.

Problems such as improper fuel consumptions, improper trips arised have to be resolved.

Impact: Can provide solution to the fleet companies by better management.
        Can put the ads of fleet companies and can get in to collaborations.
